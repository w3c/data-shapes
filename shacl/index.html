				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a language for describing and constraining the contents of RDF graphs.
				SHACL groups these descriptions and constraints into "shapes", which specify conditions that apply at a given RDF node.
				Shapes provide a high-level vocabulary to identify predicates and their associated cardinalities, datatypes and other constraints.
				Additional constraints can be associated with shapes using SPARQL and similar extension languages.
				These extension languages can also be used to define new high-level vocabulary terms.
				SHACL shapes can be used to communicate information about data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces.
				This document defines the SHACL language and its underlying semantics.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a language for describing and constraining RDF graphs. 
				SHACL can be used with RDF graphs that are obtained by any means, e.g. from the file system, HTTP requests, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF datasets</a>.
				SHACL groups descriptive information and constraints that apply to a given data node into "shapes".
				This document defines what it means for an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a>, referred to as the "data graph", to conform to a set of SHACL shapes, referred to as the "shapes graph".
				Conformance can be programmatically checked by processors referred to as "SHACL engines".
				The process of checking conformance is referred to as "validation".
				A shape may include a "scope" which defines which data nodes must conform to it.
				When a data node is checked for conformance to a shape, that node is referred to as the "focus node".
				The output of the validation process is a "validation report" which indicates whether or not the data graph conforms to the shapes graph.
				If any constraints are not satisfied, then the validation report will include one or more "violations" which indicate the source of the problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, SHACL can be used to check whether all the nodes in a data graph that have a type link to <code>foaf:Person</code> have a single value for <code>foaf:mbox</code>, and that that value is an IRI.
				SHACL can also be used to check whether a particular node in a data graph, say the node <code>ex:bug1</code>, has at least one
				value for <code>ex:reportedBy</code> and all such values have an <code>rdf:type</code> link to <code>foaf:Person</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The simplest interface to a SHACL processor has two inputs:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A <span class="term">data graph</span> that contains the data that is to be validated</li>
				<li>A <span class="term">shapes graph</span> containing shape definitions and other information that can be utilized to determine what validation is to be done</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For example, one might use SHACL to determine whether data graphs that contain information about issues and users conform to the following constraints:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>each issue is in either an unassigned or an assigned state, and</li>
				<li>each issue has a reporter and each such reporter has a precisely one string name and one or more IRI mailboxes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A shapes graph that defines these constraints has two shapes.
				The first, <code>ex:IssueShape</code> contains the two constraints on issues.
				The second, <code>ex:UserShape</code>, contains the two constraints on reporters.
				<code>ex:IssueShape</code> also contains scope information which in this case says that its constraints apply to all nodes that have an <code>rdf:type</code> link to <code>ex:Issue</code>.
			</p>
			<pre class="example" title="Definition of ex:IssueShape and ex:UserShape">
ex:IssueShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:scopeClass ex:Issue;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:state ;
		sh:in (ex:unassigned ex:assigned) ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:maxCount 1 ;
	] ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:reportedBy ;
		sh:valueShape ex:UserShape ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:maxCount 1 ;
	] .

ex:UserShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate foaf:name ;
		sh:datatype xsd:string ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:maxCount 1 ;
	] ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate foaf:mbox ;
		sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
	] .</pre>
			<p>
				The following data graph might be validated against this shapes graph.
			</p>
			<pre class="example" title="Definition of ex:IssueShape and ex:UserShape">
inst:Issue1
	a ex:Issue ;
	ex:state ex:unassigned ;
	ex:reportedBy inst:User2 .

inst:User2
	a foaf:Person ;
	foaf:name "Bob Smith" ;
	foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:bob@example.org&gt; ;
	foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:rs@example.org&gt; .

inst:Issue3
	a ex:Issue ;
	ex:state ex:unsinged ;
	ex:reportedBy inst:User4 .

inst:User4
	a foaf:Person ;
	foaf:name "Bob Smith", "Robert Smith" ;
	foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:bob@example.org&gt; ;
	foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:rs@example.org&gt; .</pre>
			<p>
				The SHACL validation would validate <code>ex:IssueShape</code> against <code>inst:Issue1</code> and <code>inst:Issue3</code>.
				Validating the first node would determine that <code>inst:Issue1</code> satisfies the constraints in <code>ex:IssueShape</code>, along the way determining that <code>inst:User2</code> satisfies the constraints in <code>ex:UserShape</code>.
				Validating the second node would determine that <code>inst:Issue3</code> violates the constraint on values for <code>ex:state</code>, because <code>ex:unsigned</code> is not in the list of allowed values,
				and also violates the constraint on values for <code>ex:reportedBy</code>, because <code>inst:User4</code> violates the <code>ex:UserShape</code> constraint on the maximum number of values for <code>foaf:name</code>.

				<h3>Relationship between SHACL and RDFS</h3>
				<p>
					SHACL uses RDF and RDFS vocabulary (in particular <code>rdf:type</code>, <code>rdfs:Class</code>, <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdfs:label</code>, <code>rdfs:comment</code>, <code>rdf:Property</code>, <code>rdf:List</code>,
					<code>rdf:langLiteral</code>, and <code>rdfs:Resource</code>) and notions (notably classes, instances, and subclasses).
					However, SHACL does not use this vocabulary or these notions in the way that they are defined in RDF and RDFS [[!rdf11-mt]].				
				</p>
				<p>
					When determining subclass and instance relationships SHACL only uses the transitive closure of <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>,
					ignoring in particular the RDF axioms, the RDFS meaning of <code>rdfs:Resource</code>, the reflexivity of <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>,
					the effect of subproperties of <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, and the effects of <code>rdfs:domain</code> and <code>rdfs:range</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> transitivity is not uniformly applied throughout SHACL.
					It is only used when SHACL explicitly determines type and subclass relationships in the shapes graph and the data.
					In other places only triples that are explicitly present in the shapes graph or the data are considered.
					For example, SHACL property constraints on <code>rdf:type</code> and <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> only utilize triples that are explicitly in the data.
					Similarly, subproperties of <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>rdfs:commment</code> and subclasses of <code>rdf:List</code> are not recognized in the shapes graph.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="shacl-sparql">
				<h3>Relationship between SHACL and SPARQL</h3>
				<p>
					This specification uses SPARQL 1.1 for the normative definition of the semantics of the SHACL Core constraints and scopes.
					Implementations do not have to use the exact same SPARQL queries, and do not even have to use SPARQL at all.
					However, all implementation MUST produce the same outputs for the same inputs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The SPARQL definitions in this document use the convention that the variables starting with <code>$</code> must be substituted
					with values that have been passed into the query from the outside, similar to the semantics of a VALUES clause.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some places, the specification assumes that the provided SPARQL engines are preserving the identity of blank nodes,
					so that repeated invocations of queries consistently identify and communicate the same blank nodes.
					<span class="todo">TODO: what is the best wording to make this clearer?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					The definition of some constraints require access to a named graph represented with the variable <code>$shapesGraph</code>.
					Not all implementations (such as those using SPARQL endpoints) may be able to provide this named graph in the same dataset as the executing query.
					Such implementations may need to find alternative techniques (such as string insertion) leading to equivalent results. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The definition of some constraints assume that SPARQL engines provide a function called <code>sh:hasShape</code> as elaborated in the <a href="#constraints">beginning of section 3</a>.
					In the advanced sections, SHACL introduces mechanisms to define constraints, scopes and new functions in SPARQL.
					Implementations that only plan to cover the SHACL Core features are not required to support those mechanisms.

			<h2>Shapes</h2>
			<p>
				A <span class="term">shape</span> is a group of constraints that nodes can be validated against.
				In the SHACL RDF vocabulary, shapes are instances of the class <code>sh:Shape</code> (or subclasses of <code>sh:Shape</code>).
				When a node is validated against a constraint, it is called the <span class="term">focus node</span>.
				Shapes may have <span class="term">scopes</span> that instruct a SHACL processor on how to select those focus nodes,
				and may also have <span class="term">filter shapes</span> that narrow down the scope.
				For example, a shape can be used to state that all instances of a class must have a certain number of values for a given property.
				In that example, the instances of the class are the focus nodes in the scope, and the restriction on property values is expressed via a constraint.
				Both concepts are illustrated by the following figure, and introduced in the following sub-sections.

			<section id="scopes">
				<h3>Scopes</h3>
				<p>
					SHACL shapes can have three kinds of scopes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#nodeShape"><b>Individual scopes</b></a> link a specific resource with a shape via <code>sh:nodeShape</code>.
					<li><a href="#scopeClass"><b>Class-based scopes</b></a> link all instances of a given class with a shape, using <code>sh:scopeClass</code> and <code>rdf:type</code>.</li>
					<li><a href="#scope"><b>General scopes</b></a> define a flexible mechanism to produce arbitrary focus nodes for a given data graph.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If multiple scope definitions are present for a shape then a SHACL processor MUST use the union of the focus nodes produced by those scopes.
				</p>
				
				<section id="nodeShape">
					<h4>Individual scopes (sh:nodeShape)</h4>
					<div class="issue" data-number="61" title="Direction of sh:nodeShape">
						There is an alternative proposal discussed that would reverse the direction of this, pointing from the shape to the nodes.
					</div>
					<p>
						Individual nodes can point to the shapes that they are supposed to be validated against using the property <code>sh:nodeShape</code>.
						The values of <code>sh:nodeShape</code> must be IRIs.
						This pattern is illustrated in the following example. 				
					</p>
					<pre class="example" title="Scope based on sh:nodeShape">

					<h4>Class-based Scopes (sh:scopeClass and rdf:type)</h4>
					<p>
						RDF Schema provides a well-established framework to model domains in terms of classes and instances.
						A lot of existing data is already represented this way.
						The property <code>sh:scopeClass</code> can be used to link a <code>sh:Shape</code> with an <code>rdfs:Class</code>.
						The property <code>rdf:type</code> is used to determine which shapes a given node are expected to fulfill.
						The scope includes all instances of the <code>sh:scopeClass</code> and its subclasses, by following <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> triples.
						This pattern is illustrated in the following example.
					</p>
					<pre class="example" title="Scope based on rdf:type and sh:scopeClass">

					<div class="issue" data-number="23" title="Classes and/or Shapes">
						There is no agreement in the WG on the relationship between sh:Shape and rdfs:Class.
						In the absence of such an agreement, this document uses sh:Shape in most examples but allows
						classes to be also shapes, with the class sh:ShapeClass as syntactic sugar.
					</div>
					<p>
						If the type class of an instance is also an instance of <code>sh:Shape</code> then the <code>sh:scopeClass</code> triple MAY be omitted and <code>rdf:type</code> MAY directly link a resource with its shapes.
						In this <span class="term">scope</span>, the IRIs of classes double as shape definitions, i.e. it is possible to directly link constraints to the IRI of a class.
						As syntactic sugar, the metaclass <code>sh:ShapeClass</code> can be used as a combination of <code>rdfs:Class</code> and <code>sh:Shape</code>.
						This pattern is illustrated in the following example.
					</p>
					<pre class="example" title="Scope based on rdf:type only">

				<h3>Filter Shapes</h3>
				<p>
					In some cases, constraints should not apply to all focus nodes, produced by a scope.
					For example, instances of the given class <code>ex:Person</code> that were <code>ex:residentIn</code>
					the country <code>ex:USA</code> may have a different legal drinking age than others.
					In order to support such use cases, SHACL includes the concept of <span class="term">filter shapes</span> that act as pre-conditions that all focus nodes need to fulfill before they are being validated.
					Formally, filter shapes eliminate entries from the collection of focus nodes selected by a shape's scopes, if the focus node produces a validation result with severity <code>sh:Violation</code> or a failure for the given filter shapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following example states that the <code>sh:minCount</code> constraint only applies to resources that have a certain value for <code>ex:requiredProperty</code>. 
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Constraint with a filter shape">

				Alternatively, <code>sh:filterShape</code> can be defined for a whole shape, with the meaning

					A shape defines a group of constraints.
					SHACL includes a collection of Core constraint types that are covered in the next section.
					Additional types of constraints can be added using the <a href="#template-constraints">extension mechanism</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shapes can be linked to their constraints via the following properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>sh:property</code> links a shape with constraints about a given property of the focus node.
						These constraints are called <a href="#constraints-property"><span class="term">property constraints</span></a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>sh:inverseProperty</code> links a shape with constraints about a given property traversed in the inverse direction of the focus node.
						These constraints are called <a href="#constraints-inverse-property"><span class="term">inverse property constraints</span></a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>sh:constraint</code> link a shape with constraints that do not involve just a single dedicated property.
						SHACL includes <a href="#constraints-property-pair"><span class="term">property pair constraints</span></a> and
						<a href="#constraints-other">other constraints</a> such as logical operators.
					</li>

			<h2>Core Constraint Types</h2>
			<p>
				The following sections define the constraint types built into the SHACL Core.
				Compliant SHACL engines MUST support all of these constraints.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the textual definitions of the constraint types refer to the <a href="#results">Validation Results Vocabulary</a>
				introduced in a later section.
			</p>
			<p>
				The SPARQL definitions in this section assume the following variable bindings:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The variable <code>$this</code> is assumed to point at the current focus node.</li>
				<li>The variable <code>$shapesGraph</code> points at the IRI of the <span class="term">shapes graph</span> in the current dataset.</li>
				<li>The variable <code>$currentShape</code> points at the currently evaluated shape.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Each row in the result set of the SPARQL queries in this document represents one <span class="term">validation result</span>.
				The other variables in the SELECT clause are mapped to the details of each <a href="#results">validation result</a>, e.g. <code>?object</code> is mapped to <code>sh:object</code>.
				<span class="todo">(Clarify what exact compliance level is required, e.g. do they need to produce focus nodes)</span>
				If a row in a SPARQL result set produces <code>true</code> as value for the variable <code>?failure</code> then a <span class="term">failure</span> must be reported.
			</p>
			<p>
				The SPARQL definitions in this section also assume the existence of a built-in SPARQL function <code>sh:hasShape</code>, which takes the following arguments:
			</p>
			<table class="term-table">
				<tr>
					<th style="min-width: 200px">Argument</th>
					<th>Value Type</th>
					<th>Summary</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>$focusNode</code></td>
					<td><code>rdfs:Resource</code></td>
					<td>The focus node to validate.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>$shape</code></td>
					<td><code>sh:Shape</code></td>
					<td>The shape to validate the focus node against.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>$shapesGraph</code></td>
					<td><code>rdfs:Resource</code></td>
					<td>The current <span class="term">shapes graph</span>.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>$recursionIsError</code></td>
					<td><code>xsd:boolean</code></td>
					<td>
						If set to <code>true</code> then any recursive occurrence of the same resource against the same shape signals a failure,
						with the function returning <span class="term">undefined</span>.
						If not <code>true</code> then any recursive occurrence must return <code>true</code>.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				The result of the <code>sh:hasShape</code> function is either <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> or <span class="term">undefined</span>.
				The function returns <code>true</code> if the validation of the <code>?focusNode</code> against the given <code>?shape</code> produces no validation results with severity <code>sh:Violation</code>.
				The validation algorithm of <code>sh:hasShape</code> itself is based the <a href="#operation-validateNodeAgainstShape"><code>validateNodeAgainstShape</code> operation</a>.
				Note that any validation results produced inside of the <code>sh:hasShape</code> function are temporary, i.e. they are not added to the results graph of the surrounding execution environment.
				However, some implementations may add those nested validation results as annotations to the surrounding validation results, via <a href="#results-detail"><code>sh:detail</code></a>.
			</p>

			<section id="constraints-property">
				<h3>Property Constraints (sh:property)</h3>
				<p>
					A <span class="term">property constraint</span> is a constraint that defines restrictions on the values of a given property in the context of the focus node.
					Here, the focus node is the <span class="term">subject</span> and the property is the <span class="term">predicate</span> of relevant triples.
					The property <code>sh:property</code> can be used to link a shape with its property constraints.
				</p>
				<p>
					In SHACL, property constraints are instances of the class <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					When used as values of <code>sh:property</code>, property constraints do not require an <code>rdf:type</code> triple.
					However, if those values are IRIs, then they SHOULD have an <code>rdf:type</code> triple.
					Note that <code>sh:property</code> may also have values that are sub-classes of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>,
					but in this case the <code>rdf:type</code> triple is required.
					It is not valid to use <code>sh:property</code> for constraints that are not instance of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				</p>
				<p> 
					The following examples illustrate two ways of using property constraints.
					The first example uses a blank node:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Property constraint represented by a blank node">
ex:InlinePropertyConstraintExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:someProperty ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:class ex:SomeClass ;
		rdfs:label "some property" ;
		rdfs:comment "Description of the role of ex:someProperty (in the context of the constraint)" ;
	] .</pre>
				<p>
					The second example defines a constraint as an IRI node, allowing it to be more easily referenced and shared across multiple shapes:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Property constraint represented by a IRI">
ex:StandAlonePropertyConstraintExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property ex:StandAloneConstraint .

ex:StandAloneConstraint
	a sh:PropertyConstraint ;
	sh:predicate ex:someProperty ;
	sh:defaultValue ex:SomeInstance ;
	sh:minCount 1 ;
	sh:class ex:SomeClass .</pre>
				<p>
					Property constraints may have an <code>rdfs:label</code> to provide a human-readable label for the property	in the scope where it appears.
					If present, tools SHOULD prefer those locally defined labels over globally defined labels at the <code>rdf:Property</code> itself.
					For example, if a form displays a resource that is in the scope of a given shape, and the shape defines a <code>sh:property</code> constraint with an <code>rdfs:label</code>, then the tool SHOULD use the provided label.
					Similarly, property constraints may have an <code>rdfs:comment</code> to provide a description of the property in the given context.
					Both <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>rdfs:comment</code> may have multiple values, but SHOULD only have one value per language tag.
				</p>
				<p id="defaultValue">
					Property constraints may have a single value for <code>sh:defaultValue</code>.
					The default value does not have fixed semantics in SHACL, but MAY be used by user interface tools to pre-populate input widgets.
					The value type of the <code>sh:defaultValue</code> SHOULD align with the specified <code>sh:datatype</code>, <code>sh:directType</code> or <code>sh:class</code> of the same constraint.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following sections provide details on the properties that may be used with <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					None of these properties can be repeated within the same <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					In order to define multiple constraints using the same property, such as multiple <code>sh:hasValue</code> constraints, the shape must use multiple <code>sh:property</code> definitions.
				</p>
				<p class="todo">
					Note that this chapter is work in progress to implement the resolution to ISSUE-98.
					In a nutshell, these constraint types can be used either at sh:constraint (to apply to the focus node itself),
					at sh:property (to apply to all values of a given property), or at sh:inverseProperty (to apply to all inverse values of a given property).
					Which combinations are supported is summarized in the following table.
					The flow of the sub-sections needs to be adjusted and generalized accordingly.

			<h2>Validation Results Vocabulary</h2>

				The output of a SHACL constraint validation process is a set of <span class="term">validation results</span>.
				SHACL includes an RDF vocabulary to represent such results together with
				structural information that may provide guidance on how to fix a violation, as well as
				human-readable messages.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following code snippet represents a syntactically correct result that may have been produced by a constraint validation engine:
			</p>
			<pre class="example" title="A constructed validation result">

	sh:object ex:someInvalidValue ;
	sh:message "Incorrect value: expected something else here." .</pre>
			<p>
				Validation results must be instances of the class <code>sh:ValidationResult</code>.
				Its superclass <code>sh:AbstractResult</code> defines the properties described in the following sub-sections.
				SHACL implementations may produce instances of other subclasses of <code>sh:AbstractResult</code>, for example
				to report successfully completed constraint checks or accumulated results.
			</p>
			<section id="results-focus-node">
				<h4>sh:focusNode</h4>
				<p>
					Validation results may have a single value for the property <code>sh:focusNode</code> to point to an
					IRI or blank node that has caused the result.
					This represents the <span class="term">focus node</span> that was validated when the validation result was produced.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results-triple">
				<h4>sh:subject, sh:predicate and sh:object</h4>
				<p>
					Validation results are often caused by a single RDF triple, or a predicate in the context of a given subject or object.
					This information can be encoded via the properties <code>sh:subject</code>, <code>sh:predicate</code> and <code>sh:object</code>,
					each of which can have at most one value.
					<code>sh:predicate</code> can only be present if either <code>sh:subject</code> or <code>sh:object</code> have also been specified.
					If <code>sh:object</code> is unspecified, then the interpretation is that the result is caused by the subject/predicate combination.
					If <code>sh:subject</code> is unspecified, then the interpretation is that the result is caused by the object/predicate combination.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results-source">
				<h4>sh:sourceConstraint, sh:sourceShape and sh:sourceTemplate</h4>
				<p>
					Validation results may point at one <code>sh:Constraint</code> that has caused
					the result, specified via the property <code>sh:sourceConstraint</code>,
					and at the <code>sh:Shape</code> defining the constraint, via <code>sh:sourceShape</code>.
					Validation results that were produced by a <a href="#template-constraints">template call</a> may
					point at the <code>sh:ConstraintTemplate</code> that caused the result.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results-detail">
				<h4>sh:detail</h4>
				<p>
					The property <code>sh:detail</code> may link a (parent) result with one or more other

				Part 1 of this specification has introduced features that are built into the Core of SHACL.

			<h2>Native Constraints</h2>
			<p>
				The property <code>sh:constraint</code> provides the most general mechanism to associate a constraint with a shape.
				The values of this property must be <span class="term">constraints</span> - instances of the class <code>sh:Constraint</code>.
				Note that the property <code>sh:property</code> SHOULD be used instead of <code>sh:constraint</code> if the constraint is a <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				The property <code>sh:inverseProperty</code> SHOULD be used instead of <code>sh:constraint</code> if the constraint is a <code>sh:InversePropertyConstraint</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				SHACL supports two types of general constraints:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Constraints based on a high-level vocabulary (<a href="#template-constraints">templates</a>)</li>
				<li>Constraints based on a native executable (such as a SPARQL query)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following sub-sections are about the latter, while templates are covered at a later stage.
			</p>
			<section class="informative">
				<h3>An Example Native Constraint</h3>
				<p>
					For the sake of this example, we assume a data graph containing the following instances:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Example ex:Country instances">
ex:ValidCountry
	a ex:Country ;
	ex:germanLabel "Spanien"@de .
  
ex:InvalidCountry
	a ex:Country ;
	ex:germanLabel "Spain"@en .</pre>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates the definition of a <span class="term">native constraint</span> based on a SPARQL query.
					The property <code>sh:sparql</code> is used to point at a SELECT query as explained in a later <a href="#native-constraints-sparql">section</a>.
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Example Shape with a native SPARQL constraint">
ex:LanguageExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:scopeClass ex:Country ;
	sh:constraint [
		sh:message "Values must be literals with German language tag." ;
		sh:sparql """
			SELECT $this ($this AS ?subject) (ex:germanLabel AS ?predicate) (?value AS ?object)
			WHERE {
				$this ex:germanLabel ?value .
				FILTER (!isLiteral(?value) || !langMatches(lang(?value), "de"))
			}
			""" ;
	] .</pre>
				<p>
					The scope of the shape includes all instances of <code>ex:Country</code>.
					For those instances (represented by the variable <code>$this</code>), the SPARQL query walks through the values of <code>ex:germanLabel</code>
					and verifies that they are literals with a German language code.
					The output of the graph validation for the instances above is shown in the next example: 
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Example validation results">
[
	a sh:ValidationResult ;
	sh:severity sh:Violation ;
	sh:focusNode ex:InvalidCountry ;
	sh:subject ex:InvalidCountry ;
	sh:predicate ex:focusNode ;
	sh:object "Spain"@en ;
	sh:sourceShape ex:LanguageExampleShape ;
	...
]
</pre>
				<p>
					The SPARQL query returns result set rows for all bindings of <code>?value</code> that violate the constraint.
					A validation result is produced for each row in that result set, using <code>$this</code> as the <code>sh:focusNode</code> and <code>sh:subject</code>,
					<code>ex:germanLabel</code> as <code>sh:predicate</code> and the violating value as <code>sh:object</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the example above, it is assumed that the existing SHACL engine is capable of evaluating native constraints using SPARQL, as described in the following section.
					Additional executable languages such as JavaScript may be provided based on other sets of properties like <code>ex:javaScript</code>,
					but that is outside of the scope of this specification.

				<h3>SPARQL-based Native Constraints</h3>
				<p>
					Native SPARQL constraints are instances of <code>sh:SPARQLConstraint</code>, which is a subclass of <code>sh:NativeConstraint</code>, which in turn is a subclass of <code>sh:Constraint</code>.
					Native SPARQL constraints must have one value for the property <code>sh:sparql</code>.
					The SPARQL queries linked to a <span class="term">constraint</span> via <code>sh:sparql</code> must be string literals that can be parsed into legal SPARQL 1.1 queries	of the query form <code>SELECT</code>.

					<h4>Injecting Annotation Properties into Validation Results</h4>

							<td>Constant nodes that shall be used as default values</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>
						For each row of a SELECT result set, a SHACL processor must walk through the declared result annotations.
						The mapping from result annotations to SPARQL variables uses the following rules:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If a <code>sh:resultAnnotation</code> defines a <code>sh:annotationVarName</code> then the engine must look for the variable named after the <code>sh:annotationVarName</code></li>
						<li>Otherwise, the engine must derive a variable name from the value of <code>sh:annotationProperty</code> using the same <a href="#template-arguments">local name mechanism</a> as described earlier</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						If a variable name could be determined, then the engine must copy the bindings for the given variable into the constructed validation results for the current row.
						If the variable has no binding in the result set row, then the value of <code>sh:annotationValue</code> must be used, if present.
					</p>
					<p>
						The values of <code>sh:annotationProperty</code> must not be from the SHACL namespace, to avoid clashes with variables that are already produced by other means.

						Here is a slightly complex example, illustrating the use of result annotations.

			<h2>Template Constraints</h2>
			<p>
				Native constraints in a language like SPARQL as introduced in the previous section typically provide a lot of flexibility.
				However, SPARQL-based constraints may also be hard to understand for some people, and may be repetitive.
				<span class="term">Templates</span> can be used to encapsulate and parameterize such native queries.
				<span class="term">Constraint templates</span> can be instantiated anywhere where a native constraint may appear (in particular, at <code>sh:constraint</code>).
				<span class="term">Scope templates</span> can be instantiated anywhere where a native scope may appear, at <code>sh:scope</code>.
				All of the constraint and scope types built into the SHACL Core are also represented as templates in the SHACL RDF vocabulary.
				Such templates form a high-level vocabulary that may also be directly interpreted ("hard-coded") without reliance on the fact that they are templates.
			</p>
			<p>
				Constraint templates are represented as IRI nodes that are instances of the class <code>sh:ConstraintTemplate</code>.
				Scope templates are represented as IRI nodes that are instances of the class <code>sh:ScopeTemplate</code>.
				SHACL also includes a more general superclass <code>sh:Template</code> that may be used for other kinds of templates (rules, stored queries etc).
				Well-defined, non-abstract templates must provide at least one <span class="term">body</span> using a property such as <a href="#sparql-templates"><code>sh:sparql</code></a>.

				<h3>An Example Template Constraint</h3>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates the definition of a constraint template based on a SPARQL query.
					It is a variation of the native example constraint from the previous section.
					That SPARQL query included two constants: the specific property <code>ex:germanLabel</code> and the language tag <code>de</code>.
					Templates make it possible to generalize such scenarios, so that constants get substituted with <span class="term">arguments</span>.
					This allows the query logic to be reused in multiple places, without having to write any new SPARQL.

				</p>

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="term">local name</span> must be a valid <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rVARNAME">SPARQL VARNAME</a></li>
					<li>There must not be any other declared <code>sh:Argument</code> for the same template (and its transitive superclasses) that has a <code>sh:predicate</code> with the same <span class="term">local name</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may have its property <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code>
					to indicate that the argument is not mandatory.

				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare a default value via <code>sh:defaultValue</code>.
					For non-optional arguments, the engine must use the declared default value for template instances that do not define a value for this argument.
					Template instances can have at most one value for each argument predicate.

				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare one value for the property <code>sh:class</code> or one value for
					<code>sh:datatype</code>, similar to their counterparts in property constraints.
					Likewise, an <code>sh:Argument</code> may specify a <code>sh:NodeKind</code> via <code>sh:nodeKind</code>.
					This can be used to communicate the expected value type of the argument in template instances.
					Some implementations MAY use this information to prevent the execution of a template with invalid arguments.

					Only template instances that are complete will be used - incomplete templates will be (silently) ignored during constraint validation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Constraint templates may be placed in a <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> relationship with other templates.

				In addition to the scope classes introduced in the core section, such as <code>sh:PropertyScope</code>,
				SHACL provides facilities to define custom scopes.
				Similar to constraints, scopes may either be <span class="term">native scopes</span> or be an instance of <code>sh:TemplateScope</code>.
				All this is analogous to how constraints work, but with the additional restrictions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All subjects of <code>sh:scope</code> triples must be IRIs</li>
				<li>The arguments of a scope template must not be blank nodes</li>
			</ul>
			<section id="sparql-scopes">
				<h3>SPARQL-based Scopes</h3>
				<p>
					SPARQL-based scopes must be instances of <code>sh:SPARQLScope</code>, which is a subclass of <code>sh:NativeScope</code>.
					The SPARQL queries linked to a <span class="term">scope</span> via <code>sh:sparql</code> must be of the query form <code>SELECT</code>.
					The SELECT queries must project to the result variable <code>?this</code>.
					The resulting scope consists of all distinct bindings for the variable <code>?this</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The SELECT queries must also be executable when converted to an ASK query and with a pre-bound value for <code>?this</code>.
					The set of bindings for <code>?this</code> that return <code>true</code> for such ASK queries must be identical to the set produced by the SELECT query.
					This constraint makes sure that engines can validate whether a given shape applies to a given focus node as part of the <a href="#operation-validateNode">validateNode</a> operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates a well-formed SPARQL-based scope that produces all persons born in the USA:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="SPARQL-based scope example">
ex:USCitizenShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:scope [
		a sh:SPARQLScope ;
		sh:sparql """

			WHERE {
				?this a ex:Person .
				?this ex:bornIn ex:USA .

			<h2>Functions</h2>
			<p>
				SHACL <span class="term">functions</span> define operations that produce an RDF node based on zero or more arguments and a dataset.
				Functions can be called within SPARQL queries to encapsulate complex logic of other SPARQL queries, or executable logic in other languages such as JavaScript.
				However, the general declaration mechanism for SHACL functions is independent from SPARQL and may also be exploited by other environments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Functions must be declared as instances of the class <code>sh:Function</code>.
				Well-defined, non-abstract functions must provide at least one body property such as <a href="#sparql-functions"><code>sh:sparql</code></a>.
			</p>
			<section class="informative">
				<h3>An Example Function</h3>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates the definition of a <span class="term">function</span> based on a SPARQL query.
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="SHACL function with a SPARQL body">
ex:exampleFunction
	a sh:Function ;

				<p>
					Based on the declaration above, SPARQL engines with full SHACL support can install a new SPARQL function based on the SPARQL 1.1 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#extensionFunctions">Extensible Value Testing</a> mechanism.
					Such engines are then able to handle expressions such as <code>ex:exampleFunction(40, 2)</code>, producing <code>42</code>, as illustrated in the following SPARQL query.
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Call of a SHACL function in a SPARQL query">
SELECT ?subject
WHERE {
	?subject ex:myProperty ?value .
	FILTER (ex:exampleFunction(?value, 2) = 42) .
}</pre>
				<p>
					The following sections introduce the properties that all such functions may have.
					A later <a href="#sparql-functions">section</a> provides additional details for SPARQL-based SHACL functions.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="function-arguments">
				<h3>Function Arguments</h3>
				<p>
					The arguments of a function are linked to its <code>sh:Function</code> via the property <code>sh:argument</code>.
					Each argument must be an instance of <code>sh:Argument</code>, but their <code>rdf:type</code> triple can be omitted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> must have exactly one value for the property <code>sh:predicate</code>.
					The values of <code>sh:predicate</code> must be IRIs, and follow the same restrictions outlined for <a href="#template-arguments">Template Arguments</a>.
					Arguments are "inherited" from the superclasses of the function.
					For example if a superclass already declares <code>sh:arg1</code> then subclasses may only define <code>sh:arg2</code> etc.
				</p>
				<p id="function-arguments-ordering">
					Arguments are ordered, corresponding to the notation of function calls in SPARQL such as
					<code>ex:exampleFunction(?arg1, ?arg2)</code>.
					The ordering of function arguments (e.g. for printing in SPARQL strings) is determined by their index.
					For each function, the indices must be 0, 1, 2 etc.  The index of each declared <code>sh:Argument</code>
					is determined as follows:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The index of the built-in argument predicates <code>sh:arg1</code>, <code>sh:arg2</code> etc is their numeric name part minus 1, e.g. <code>sh:arg1</code> has index 0.</li>
					<li>The index of other argument predicates is the value of the property <code>sh:index</code> at the surrounding <code>sh:Argument</code>.</li>
					<li>Arguments that are neither of the form <code>sh:argX</code> nor have an <code>sh:index</code> are place at the end, whereby arguments that have <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code> get a higher index than non-optional arguments.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> may have its property <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code>
					to indicate that the argument is not mandatory.
					If an argument has been declared optional, then all succeeding arguments must also be declared optional.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar to <a href="#constraints-property">Property Constraints</a>, each <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare one value for the property <code>sh:datatype</code> or one value for the property <code>sh:class</code>.
					This can be used to communicate the expected value type of the argument in function calls.
					Some implementations MAY use this information to prevent the execution of a function with invalid arguments.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="function-returnType">
				<h3>sh:returnType</h3>
				<p>
					A function may declare a single return type via <code>sh:returnType</code>.
					This information may serve for documentation purposes, only.
					However, in some execution languages such as JavaScript, the declared <code>sh:returnType</code> may inform
					the engine how to cast a native value into an RDF value type.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="ValidationFunctions">
				<h3>Validation Functions</h3>
				<p>
					It is a common design pattern for functions to take a value as input and validate whether that value fulfills certain conditions or not.
					In support of this pattern, SHACL supports <span class="term">validation functions</span>, which are instances of <code>sh:Function</code> that are also subclasses of <code>sh:ValidationFunctions</code>.
					From that superclass, these functions "inherit" the (first) argument <code>sh:value</code>.
					Validation functions may define additional arguments with <code>sh:index</code> values larger than 1.
					The following example illustrates a validation function for the running example of the <a href="#template-validation-functions">section on constraint templates</a>.
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="A validation function">
ex:hasLanguage
	a sh:Function ;
	rdfs:subClassOf sh:ValidationFunctions ;
	sh:argument [
		sh:predicate ex:lang ;
		sh:datatype xsd:string ;
		sh:index 1 ;
		rdfs:label "language" ;
		rdfs:comment "The language to match against, e.g. \"de\"." ;
	] ;
	sh:returnType xsd:boolean ;
	sh:sparql """
  		ASK {
  			FILTER (isLiteral($value) &amp;&amp; langMatches(lang($value), $lang)) .
		}
		""" .</pre>
				<p>
					An example invocation of the function above is: <code>ex:hasLanguage("Spain"@en, "en")</code>, producing <code>true</code>.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="sparql-functions">
				<h3>SPARQL-based Functions</h3>
				<p>
					If a <code>sh:Function</code> has a value for <code>sh:sparql</code> then it can be regarded as a <span class="term">SPARQL-based function</span>.
					In the SPARQL query, the engine needs to <span class="term">pre-bind</span> variables based on the provided arguments of the function call.
					The SPARQL query must be of type ASK or SELECT.
					For ASK queries, the function's return value is the result of the ASK query execution.
					For SELECT queries, the function's return value is the first binding of the first result variable in the result set.
					Since all other bindings will be ignored, such SELECT queries SHOULD only return a single result variable and at most one row.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some execution engines may ignore the specified <code>sh:sparql</code> query and rely on an alternative (possibly native) implementation instead,
					as long as the functions return the same values as the specified <code>sh:sparql</code> query.
					This can be used to optimize frequently needed functions.
					Some processors may even use the <code>sh:sparql</code> query to rewrite other SPARQL queries via inlining techniques.

		<section id="operations">
			<h2>Supported Operations</h2>
			<div class="issue" title="Specification of Operations">
				It is undecided to what extent this (operations) section is needed, and to what level of detail it should be specified.
				For now we present some high-level functions, but more details would be useful.
			</div>
			<p>
				This section enumerates the basic operations that complete SHACL engines SHOULD support.
				The specification does not prescribe how these operations are exposed to the user of a SHACL system.
				The functions are written in Java, assuming the presence of the following basic interfaces:
			</p>
			<pre class="algorithm">
// Represents RDF nodes: literals, IRIs or blank nodes.
interface Node {
}

// Represents an RDF triple
interface Triple {
	Node getSubject();
	Node getPredicate();
	Node getObject();
}

// Represents an RDF Graph
interface Graph {
	// Find operation - each argument may be null to indicate a wildcard
	Set&lt;Triple&gt; find(Node subject, Node predicate, Node object);
}

interface Dataset {
	Graph getDefaultGraph();
	Graph getNamedGraph(String iri);
}</pre>
			<p>
				The code snippets also assume access to interfaces defining constants for the various namespaces used in the code.
				For example, the value of <code>SH.Shape</code> is the IRI String for the <code>sh:Shape</code> class.
			</p>
			<p>
				All operations have access to the following fields:
			</p>
			<table class="term-table">

			<section id="defaultValueType">
				<h2>Validation of shapes graphs and the sh:defaultValueType property</h2>
				<p>
					The SHACL system vocabulary itself is using shapes, allowing SHACL constraint validation to be executed on shapes graphs, e.g. to validate the syntax of shape definitions.
					However, some system properties such as <code>sh:property</code>, <code>sh:filterShape</code> and <code>sh:argument</code> may have untyped blank nodes or IRIs as their values.
					If, for example, a value of <code>sh:property</code> is a blank node that does not have any <code>rdf:type</code>, then the assumption is that the blank node has type <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					Unless these implicit triples are present in the data graph, constraint validation will not apply the constraints defined for <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If an engine intends to validate the syntax of a SHACL shapes graph itself, it should (temporarily) add the missing <code>rdf:type</code> triples.
					The SHACL system vocabulary includes some helper triples using the predicate <code>sh:defaultValueType</code> to specify the default <code>rdf:type</code> for certain properties.
					For example, the default value type of <code>sh:property</code> is <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					These triples can be queried by a pre-processor to construct the missing type triples for the affected nodes.
					SHACL includes a template <code>sh:DefaultValueTypeRule</code> which encapsulates a SPARQL query that can be used for that purpose:
				</p>
				<pre class="algorithm">
CONSTRUCT {
	?node a ?defaultValueType .
}
WHERE {
	?predicate sh:defaultValueType ?defaultValueType .
	?anySubject ?predicate ?node .
	FILTER (NOT EXISTS { ?node a ?anyType }) .
}</pre>
				<p>
					The operations in this section assume that these default value types are present in the shapes graph, e.g.
					simplifying the test whether a given node is a <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section id="entailment">
			<h3>Entailment</h3>
			<p>
				By default, SHACL does not assume any <span class="term">entailment regime</span> [[!sparql11-entailment]] to be actviated on the data graph.
				However, the property <code>sh:entailment</code> can be used to instruct a SHACL engine to ensure that a given entailment is activated.
				The values of <code>sh:entailment</code> must be IRIs, with common use cases covered by [[!sparql11-entailment]].
				The subject of <code>sh:entailment</code> must be the IRI of the shapes graph itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the engine is not capable of supporting the given entailment regime, then it must produce a <span class="term">failure</span>.
				Standard-compliant SHACL implementations are not required to support any entailment regimes.
